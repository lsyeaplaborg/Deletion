# Deletion
delsize_count.py: calculate indel frequencies in the indicated sizes over total reads, including 1 bp, 2 â€“ 20 bp and > 20 bp.
delsize_count_sep2.py: calculate indel frequencies of different sizes over total reads.
gt1bpdelpos_count.py: calculate frequencies of the start and end points of deletions of the indicated sizes over total reads for every 20 bp bins.
1bpdelnt_count.py: calculate frequencies of 1 bp deletions at A:T or C:G nucleotides over total reads.
1bpdelpos_count.py: calculate the number of 1 bp deletion over total reads at each position along the Ig region.
1bpdelpos_remove_sd_more_than_mean.r: calculate percentages of sequences in total reads that contain 1 bp deletion at each nucleotide in the Ig region. Peaks with a standard deviation greater than the mean were excluded.
